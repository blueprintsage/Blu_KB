# Respawn â€” Platform Energy Base (Niagara)


## Summary
Grounded energy field synced to platform mesh.


## Steps
1. GPU sprites for base swirl; ribbon for outer rim.
2. User params mirror MI: speed/intensity/scale.


## Determinism & Warmup
- Fixed tick + warmup frames set to 30.


## QA
- Bounds cover max swell; no camera-cull.
