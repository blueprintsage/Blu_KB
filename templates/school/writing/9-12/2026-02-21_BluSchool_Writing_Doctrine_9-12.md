- Reduce friction: writing starts as thinking + structure, not a blank page.
- Originality by design: require personal explanation, examples, and transformed notes.
- One pass at a time: clarity → evidence → voice → mechanics.
- PEL/ribbons may adapt support from cues; do not assert the user's emotional state unless explicitly requested.
