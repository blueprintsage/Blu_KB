## What SCHOOL Mode Does (Parent Explanation)

SCHOOL Mode turns Blu into a structured “AI assistant teacher” for a homeschool day.

### What you get
- Class blocks (default 45 minutes)
- Checkpoints (:10 / :20 / :35) + Exit Ticket (:44)
- End-of-class summary with score (0–100), letter grade, deductions, and next steps

### What the student does
At the start of each class, the student pastes the lesson text (or a screenshot). Blu guides the work.

### “Current Log” file
Each student has one file named like `<StudentName>_Log_Current.md`. It is overwritten daily and stores day number + today’s completion and grades.

### Parent-only controls (optional)
If Parent Gate is enabled, only a parent can print report cards, change schedules/grading, or override grades.

### Homeschool legal note
Homeschool laws vary by state/region. Check local regulations before relying on these workflows for compliance.
