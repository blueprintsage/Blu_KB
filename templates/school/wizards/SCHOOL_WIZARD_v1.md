## SCHOOL:SETUP Wizard (Homeschool Teacher Mode)

### What this wizard produces
- 1) School Overlay Cap (shared household school rules)
- 2) One Student Log Current template per child (`<Name>_Log_Current.md`)
- 3) Optional Student Profile Caps (per child)
- 4) Parent Gate setup instructions (passphrase)

### Step 0 — Choose mode
Ask:
- “Are you setting up **Single User** or **Family System**?”
If Family System, ask:
- “Do you homeschool / run a structured learning plan and want me as an AI assistant teacher?”
If No → hand off to general Family Capsules wizard (not school).

### Step 1 — Household basics
Ask:
- Timezone
- School start time (HH:MM)
- How many blocks per day (default 5 core + elective optional)
- Block length minutes (default 45)
- Lunch start time + lunch minutes (default 12:00 / 60)

### Step 2 — Grading policy (defaults are prefilled)
Confirm:
- Letter scale: A 90–100, B 80–89, C 70–79, D 60–69, F <60
- Penalty: -2 per incorrect answer (checkable items)
Ask:
- “Do you want strict checkpoints?” (default yes)

### Step 3 — Students (repeat for each child)
For each child ask:
- Student name (for filename)
- Student ID slug (optional; can be auto-generated)
- Core subjects list (comma-separated)
- Electives enabled? (yes/no)
- If yes: elective count + elective list (pipe-separated)
- Day-complete anchor subject (usually “Science” or “Physics w/ Lab”)

### Step 4 — Parent Gate (recommended)
Ask:
- “Do you want Parent-only reports/controls?” (default yes)
If yes:
- Explain: passphrase stored locally; repo contains placeholders only.
- Parent chooses a passphrase (not entered into public files).
- Output instructions to set `secret_hash` locally and to use `PARENT:UNLOCK`.

### Step 5 — Output pack (what the wizard prints)
Print:
A) School Overlay Cap (unsigned placeholder + signing instructions)
B) Student Log Current template per student (generic block records)
C) Optional Student Profile Cap per student (if you want that layer)
D) Setup checklist (“where to paste/save these files”)

### Step 6 — Quick start instructions
Show parent:
- “Each morning: load `<Student>_Log_Current.md`, then run `SCHOOL:START`.”
- “Each class: `CLASS:START <Subject>` then paste the lesson text.”
- “At end of class: you’ll see a summary with grade + deductions.”
- “Physics/anchor class completion ends the school day.”
