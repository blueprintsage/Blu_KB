# Shape Location Basics
**Objective:** Spawn on/inside simple shapes.
## Recipe
- Add **Shape Location**; Mode: Sphere/Circle/Cone/Box; check **Surface Only** for rims.
- Radius/Extents set scale; use **Offset from Surface** to float above geometry.
## Checks
- Particles clearly match the shape; toggling Surface Only fills vs rims.
