# Forcefield â€” Spherical Shockwave (Niagara)


## Summary
Expanding spherical shockwave with refraction ring and dust motes.


## Walkthrough (generic)
- Emitter A: expanding ring (quad); animate UVs for ripples; use refraction material lightly.
- Emitter B: sparse GPU sprites pushed by outward force for dust.
- Expose duration/radius curves for timing control.


## QA
Keep refraction under perf budget; ensure far bounds for large waves.
