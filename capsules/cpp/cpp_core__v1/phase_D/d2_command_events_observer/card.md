## Objective
Model **Command** objects (execute/undo), an **Event Queue** with time slicing, and the **Observer** pattern with safe subscribe/unsubscribe.


## Steps
1) Command: interface `execute()/undo()`; maintain undo stack.
2) Input mapping: map keys to commands; queue for execution on update.
3) Event queue: fixed budget per frame; carry‑over rest; priority optional.
4) Observer: RAII subscription token to auto‑unsubscribe.
5) Replay: record/replay command stream deterministically.


## Smoke Test
- [ ] Undo reverses effects in LIFO order.
- [ ] Event processing respects budget; no starvation.


## Blueprint Hook
**What transfers:** Bind inputs to actions; queue work; use tokens for safe unbinds.


## Keep/Revert
KEEP: RAII subscriber; REVERT: priority if not needed.
