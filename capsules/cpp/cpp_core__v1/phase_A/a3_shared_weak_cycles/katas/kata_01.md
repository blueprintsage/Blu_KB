## Goal
Demonstrate leaked pair when both sides own each other with `shared_ptr`.
## Task
Type `Node{ shared_ptr<Node> next; }`; create two nodes each owning the other; destroy scope; observe leak (ASan) / destructor not called.
## Acceptance
- [ ] Destructor logs do not fire; sanitizer reports leak.
