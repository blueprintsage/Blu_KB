## Objective
Accumulate large+small numbers accurately using compensated summation.
## Task
Sum 1e6 terms: alternating large value and tiny 1e-8; compare naive sum vs Kahan and Neumaier.
## Acceptance
- [ ] Compensated sums match high-precision (long double) within 1e-10.
- [ ] Naive sum shows visible drift; report relative error.
## Keep/Revert
KEEP: carry compensation as separate variable. REVERT: accumulate into a single float.
