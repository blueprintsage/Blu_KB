## Objective
Annotate tiles/rooms with tags (biome, difficulty) and enforce adjacency/theme rules.
## Tasks
- Assign tags during generation; post‑validate adjacency constraints (e.g., lava next to basalt only).  
- Export tags for downstream use.
## Acceptance
- [ ] No forbidden adjacencies; theme density within bounds.  
- [ ] Exports include tag maps.
