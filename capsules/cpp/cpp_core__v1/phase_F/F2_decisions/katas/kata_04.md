## Objective
Add substates with default entry and shared transitions (superstate rules).

Implement chase.{line_of_sight,search_last_seen}; shared exit on lost target.
## Acceptance
- [ ] Entering parent routes to default child; transitions bubble correctly.
- [ ] No state leaks after rapid toggling.
