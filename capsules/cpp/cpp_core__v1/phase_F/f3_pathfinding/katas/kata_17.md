## Objective
Combine individual paths with local collision avoidance via **ORCA** constraints.
## Task
Compute preferred velocities along paths; solve linear constraints for collision‑free velocity per agent.
## Acceptance
- [ ] No collisions at moderate densities; throughput measured.
- [ ] Deterministic solutions with fixed agent order.
