## Objective
Define a simple context‑free grammar for macro layout (e.g., `Hub -> Wing Wing Boss`).
## Tasks
- Expand non‑terminals to terminals with weighted productions; map terminals to room templates.
## Acceptance
- [ ] Expansions obey grammar; invalid strings rejected.  
- [ ] Layouts map cleanly to room graph instances.
