## Objective
Bind multiple UMG meters (Health/Stamina/Ammo) to player variables with safe updates.


## Steps
1) Add bars `PB_Health`, `PB_Stamina`, `PB_Ammo` to `WBP_HUD`.
2) Expose player floats; clamp 0..1 on set.
3) Create `OnChanged` dispatcher or event-driven updates to avoid Tick.


## Acceptance
- [ ] All bars update without Tick-based bindings.
- [ ] No out-of-range values displayed.
