## Objective
Scatter actors on a grid with a seed for reproducibility; avoid overlaps with simple checks.


## Steps
1) Seed RNG; generate grid points within bounds.
2) Randomly cull points by density; test surface via line trace.
3) Spawn actors at valid points with random yaw/scale range.


## Acceptance
- [ ] Re-running with same seed reproduces layout.
- [ ] No overlapping spawns beyond tolerance.
