## Objective
Create a simple spawner that emits N enemies per wave with a cooldown and end-of-wave event.


## Steps
1) Place `TargetPoint` array for spawn locations.
2) `StartWave(N, Rate)`: spawn on timer until N; track alive count.
3) When alive hits zero, broadcast `OnWaveCleared`.


## Acceptance
- [ ] Correct count spawned; wave ends when all dead.
- [ ] Next wave waits for cooldown.
