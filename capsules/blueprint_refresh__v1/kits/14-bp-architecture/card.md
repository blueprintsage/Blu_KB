## Objective
Compose actors using components and decouple interactions using Blueprint Interfaces.


## Steps
1) Add a **HealthComponent** to handle damage/regen.
2) Create **BPI_Interact** with `Interact()`; implement on a door and a pickup.
3) Player calls `Interact()` on focused actor via interface, not concrete type.


## Acceptance
- [ ] Door and pickup both respond to Interact without casts.
- [ ] HealthComponent usable on multiple actors.
