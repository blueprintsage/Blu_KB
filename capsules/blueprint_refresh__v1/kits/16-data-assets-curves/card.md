## Objective
Parameterize gameplay using **Primary Data Assets** and **Curve** assets for tuning.


## Steps
1) Create DataAsset `DA_Weapon` (Damage, Rate, Spread).
2) Create CurveFloat `CF_Recoil`; sample over time in BP.
3) Player reads DataAsset values; applies Curve to recoil each shot.


## Acceptance
- [ ] Changing DataAsset or Curve updates behavior without BP edits.
- [ ] No hard-coded constants remain in logic.
