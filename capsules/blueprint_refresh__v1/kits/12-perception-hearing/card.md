## Objective
Upgrade PawnSensing to AIPerception with hearing; generate a noise on shots to lure AI.


## Steps
1) Add `AIPerception` to AI; sight + hearing senses.
2) Player: when firing, call `ReportNoiseEvent`.
3) BT: On hearing, set `LastKnownLocation` and investigate.


## Acceptance
- [ ] AI reacts to noise out of sight.
- [ ] Returns to patrol if nothing found.
