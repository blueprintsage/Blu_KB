## Objective
Add BT tasks for melee attack when in range; investigate last known location when target lost.


## Steps
1) Blackboard: `TargetActor`, `LastKnownLocation` (Vector).
2) Task_Attack: check range; play montage; cooldown.
3) Task_Investigate: move to `LastKnownLocation`, wait, clear.


## Acceptance
- [ ] Attack triggers only in range and respects cooldown.
- [ ] Investigate fires after loss and returns to patrol.
