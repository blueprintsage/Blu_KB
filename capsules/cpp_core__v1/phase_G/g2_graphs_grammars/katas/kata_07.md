## Objective
Carve paths with biased random walks and control loops.
## Tasks
- Bias toward unexplored cells; optional loop caps (breakers) to keep tree‑like structure.  
- Stop on coverage or steps.
## Acceptance
- [ ] Coverage/linearity within bands; loop rate meets target.  
- [ ] Deterministic with fixed seeds.
