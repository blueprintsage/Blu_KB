# DP-VID-001 Video Preproduction
**Scope:** Storyboards, shot lists, coverage, continuity, edit-ready planning.

### Schema
**Required**
- Project type (ad / short / doc / vlog / tutorial)
- Runtime target (or scene count)
- Deliverable type (storyboard | shot list | coverage plan)
- Location(s) + constraints (gear, crew, time)
- Style references (optional links, or descriptive)

**Optional**
- Dialogue/script excerpt
- Key beats (3–9)
- Camera kit / lens kit
- Audio approach (boom/lavs/VO)

### Checks
- [ ] Every beat has at least one **primary shot** and one **coverage option**.
- [ ] Continuity: eyeline + screen direction consistent; 180° line respected (or explicitly broken with intent).
- [ ] Shots specify: framing + action + camera move + purpose (what the edit needs).
- [ ] No “missing insert” risk: props/hands/doorways/text are covered where needed.
- [ ] If dialogue: shot choices support readability (no unnecessary cross-axis confusion).

### Failure-modes
- “Edit feels jumpy” → insufficient coverage → add 2nd angle + inserts + cutaways.
- “Confusing geography” → broken screen direction → re-anchor with establishing shot + maintain axis.
- “Performance continuity breaks” → missing match action → add matched entrances/exits + hand inserts.
- “Too many wide shots” → weak emotional emphasis → add mediums/close-ups on turning points.
- “Schedule blow-up” → over-ambitious shot count → collapse to essential coverage set (A-cam + B-roll).

### Knobs
- Coverage density (minimal / standard / maximal)
- Shot style (static / motivated movement / kinetic handheld)
- Visual grammar (classical / modern / doc)
- Continuity strictness (strict / flexible / stylized breaks)
- Pace target (slow burn / normal / fast-cut)
- Emotion emphasis (more reaction shots / more action beats)
- Lighting plan detail (none / basic / detailed)
- Deliverable format (table shot list / numbered panels / both)


### Working Patterns
**PAT-VID-001 Beat → Coverage Set**
- **Use when:** planning a scene quickly.
- **Steps:** define beat → choose primary (WS/MS/CU) → add 2 cover (reaction + insert/cutaway).
- **Checks:** beat is editable from at least 2 angles; one insert covers continuity risk.
- **Failure-modes:** too many shots → cut to “essential 4” (establish, action, insert, reaction).
- **Knobs:** coverage density; reaction emphasis; insert priority.

**PAT-VID-002 Continuity Anchor**
- **Use when:** geography/axis gets confusing.
- **Steps:** mark 180° line → choose A-side camera zone → keep eyelines consistent → re-establish after any axis break.
- **Checks:** audience can point where characters are; screen direction consistent.
- **Failure-modes:** accidental axis break → swap shot order or add neutral cutaway.
- **Knobs:** strictness; axis break style.

### Drills
- **DRL-VID-001 (10 min):** Take 3 beats and produce an “essential 4” coverage set + 3 checks.
- **DRL-VID-002 (15 min):** Fix a continuity problem: rewrite shot list to restore axis + add one re-establish.

### Minimal Example (micro-output)
- Beat: “Character enters, sees note, decides.”
  - Shot 1: WS establish room + entrance.
  - Shot 2: MS follow to table; action: reach note.
  - Shot 3: CU note text; insert.
  - Shot 4: CU reaction; decision beat.
**Checks:** readable geography, note text legible.
