# 4-Step Drawing Pipeline (Skeleton → Blocking → Rough → Final)

This is the default workflow for figures, creatures, buildings, and mechs.
Before drawing: review 1–2 canon refs from `skills/art/fundamentals/reference/index.md`.

---

## Step 1 — SKELETON (Gesture / Structure)
**Goal:** Pose + weight + proportion landmarks.

**Do**
- Draw a single line of action (primary rhythm).
- Place ribcage + pelvis as simple ovals/blocks (tilt matters).
- Mark: head, sternum, navel, crotch, knees, ankles, hands.

**Don’t**
- Don’t render muscles or details here.
- Don’t “correct” with tiny lines; fix with big shapes.

**Acceptance checks**
- [ ] You can point to the weight-bearing leg (or main support).
- [ ] Ribcage tilt and pelvis tilt are clear.
- [ ] Head-to-pelvis-to-feet flow reads in 2 seconds.

**Micro drill (5 min)**
- 5 poses: one line of action + ribcage/pelvis tilt only.

---

## Step 2 — BLOCKING (3D Forms)
**Goal:** Turn the skeleton into simple volumes in perspective.

**Do**
- Convert forms to: boxes (pelvis), barrels (ribcage), cylinders (limbs), wedges (hands/feet).
- Establish camera angle early (horizon / perspective cues).
- Keep overlaps clean (front forms overlap back forms).

**Don’t**
- Don’t add anatomy detail until the forms read.
- Don’t “tangent” silhouettes (avoid kissing edges).

**Acceptance checks**
- [ ] The figure/building reads as 3D from silhouette alone.
- [ ] Major forms align to one perspective/camera.
- [ ] Foreshortened limbs feel like “toward camera,” not shorter.

**Micro drill (10 min)**
- Block 1 pose twice: once from memory, once after checking refs.

---

## Step 3 — ROUGH (Planes + Anatomy/Design)
**Goal:** Add correct planes, anatomy wraps, and design decisions.

**Do**
- Add plane breaks (big light-facing planes vs shadow planes).
- Wrap anatomy over forms (Hogarth: compression vs stretch).
- Group details (3 big detail zones, not everywhere).

**Don’t**
- Don’t polish line quality yet.
- Don’t add texture everywhere—save it for Final.

**Acceptance checks**
- [ ] You can name 3 major plane turns (torso, thigh, forearm).
- [ ] Compression side and stretch side are readable.
- [ ] Detail is clustered (focal point is obvious).

**Micro drill (10 min)**
- Pick one body part (torso/arm/hand) and do “wrap lines” only.

---

## Step 4 — FINAL (Line Hierarchy / Values / Texture)
**Goal:** Clarity + finish without losing structure.

**Do**
- Use line hierarchy: thick silhouette, medium forms, thin details.
- Keep edges intentional: sharp on focal, soft on secondary.
- Add texture last (scales, cloth weave, metal scratches).

**Don’t**
- Don’t over-outline everything.
- Don’t destroy plane clarity with uniform rendering.

**Acceptance checks**
- [ ] Focal point reads first (face/weapon/gesture).
- [ ] Silhouette is clean at thumbnail size.
- [ ] Materials differ (metal vs cloth vs skin) via edge/value.

## Default Preflight (what Engine should do)
1) Identify subject type: human/building/creature/mech.
2) Load this crib sheet.
3) Recommend 2–4 refs from `skills/art/fundamentals/reference/index.md`.
4) Produce a “working set” of 8–12 bullets, then begin at Step 1.
