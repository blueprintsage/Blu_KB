# DP-ART-FIG-001.md
# Figure Drawing (Application Pack) — Uses Fundamentals: Drawing

**Recommended repo path:** `/skills/art/figure_drawing/dp/DP-ART-FIG-001.md`  
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Prereqs:** **DP-ART-FUND-001 (Fundamentals: Drawing)**

## Purpose
This DP applies the **Fundamentals pipeline** (Stick → Block → Rough → Final) to the human figure (and humanoids).  
Figure drawing is *not* a different engine — it’s the same engine with anatomy targets.

---

## Required Baseline (do not skip)
Before anatomy: you must be able to do Stage 1 + 2 reliably:
- readable action sticks
- convincing volume blocks (ribcage/pelvis/limb cylinders)
- basic foreshortening via overlap + scale

If those are failing, return to **DP-ART-FUND-001** drills.

## Figure-Specific Targets by Stage

### Stage 1 — Stick (Gesture + Balance)
**Focus:**
- line of action
- weight/balance (supporting leg)
- tilt of shoulders vs hips (counter-tilt)

**Quick landmarks:**
- Head → ribcage → pelvis stacked with a clear flow
- Hands/feet are placeholders (paddles/triangles) only

**Check:**  
Could the pose be acted out without breaking balance?

### Stage 2 — Block (Mannequin + Masses)
**Focus:**
- Ribcage as egg/barrel, pelvis as box/bowl
- Limb cylinders with clear overlaps
- Neck cylinder, shoulder girdle block-in

**Foreshortening rule:**  
Near limb segments must **overlap** and **scale up**.

**Check:**  
If you draw contour wraps on each limb cylinder, do they agree on direction in space?

### Stage 3 — Rough (Anatomy + Planes)
**Focus:**
- major muscle groups as simple masses (not striations)
- joints as structural landmarks (elbow/knee/ankle)
- face planes (brow ridge, cheekbone, jaw wedge)

**Check:**  
Do muscles attach *between* landmarks (origin/insertion logic), not float on top?

### Stage 4 — Final (Clarity + Selection)
**Focus:**
- pick the best contour line; remove search lines
- emphasize overlaps (near over far)
- simplify detail that doesn’t support form

**Check:**  
Does the figure read in 3D without shading?

## Default Figure Drill Stack (PD references)

1. **PD-ART-FIG-001 — 10-Min Gesture Sticks (Figure)**
5 poses × 1 minute.  
Rules: one line of action; clear support leg.  
Check: action readable instantly.

2. **PD-ART-FIG-002 — Mannequin Block-In (Ribcage/Pelvis)**
Same 5 poses; add ribcage/pelvis masses + limb cylinders + overlaps.  
Check: pelvis tilt and ribcage tilt are intentional (not random).

3. **PD-ART-FIG-003 — Torso Twist Study**
3 twists: front/3-4/back.  
Block ribcage/pelvis as solids; connect via spine flow.  
Check: twist direction is unambiguous.

4. **PD-ART-FIG-004 — Foreshortened Punch/Kick**
Use Z-axis overlap method for the striking limb.  
Check: near fist/foot dominates and overlaps forearm/shin.

5. **PD-ART-FIG-005 — Hands/Feet as Volumes**
Hands = box + wedge + cylinders; feet = wedge + block.  
Check: toe/finger direction follows the form, not the page.

## Common Failure Modes
- **Flat figure:** no overlap, no scale shift, no wrap lines → return to Block stage.
- **Stiff mannequin:** line of action missing → fix Stage 1 first.
- **Detail too early:** fingers/abs before torso volume → lock to Stage 2.
- **Anatomy stickers:** muscles drawn as symbols → rebuild as masses between landmarks.
