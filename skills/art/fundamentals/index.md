# Art Fundamentals — Index

**Rule:** Fundamentals live under each skillset at `skills/<skill>/fundamentals/`  
**Template:** [`/templates/FUNDAMENTALS_TEMPLATE.md`](../../../templates/FUNDAMENTALS_TEMPLATE.md)

## Purpose
Fundamentals are the **engine**: reusable building blocks that apply to *anything* in this skill.  
For art, the core engine is: **Stick → Block → Rough → Final**.

## Core Fundamentals (DP)
- **DP-ART-FUND-001 — Fundamentals: Drawing (Stick → Block → Rough → Final)**  
  [`dp/DP-ART-FUND-001.md`](dp/DP-ART-FUND-001.md)

## Application Packs (DP)
These *use* fundamentals; they don’t replace them.
- **DP-ART-FIG-001 — Figure Drawing (Application Pack)**  
  [`../figure_drawing/dp/DP-ART-FIG-001.md`](../figure_drawing/dp/DP-ART-FIG-001.md)
- **DP-ART-OBJ-001 — Object Drawing (Application Pack)**  
  [`../figure_drawing/dp/DP-ART-OBJ-001.md`](../figure_drawing/dp/DP-ART-OBJ-001.md)

## Patterns & Drills (PD)
> Short reps with pass/fail checks. Keep these tight.

- PD-ART-FUND-001 — 10-Min Action Sticks
- PD-ART-FUND-002 — 10-Min Form Blocking
- PD-ART-FUND-003 — Z-Axis Depth Drill (Foreshortening)
- PD-ART-FUND-004 — Object Swap (Any Subject)

(If a PD doesn’t exist yet, leave it listed and mark it `TODO` inside the PD stub.)
