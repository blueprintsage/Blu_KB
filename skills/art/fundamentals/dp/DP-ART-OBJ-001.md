# DP-ART-OBJ-001
# Fundamentals: Objects (Tree + Car) — Using Stick → Block → Rough → Final

**Recommended repo path:** `/skills/art/fundamentals/dp/DP-ART-OBJ-001.md`  
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Prereqs:** DP-ART-FUND-001

## Purpose
Prove that the same 4-stage engine works on non-figure subjects.
This DP provides two worked examples: **Tree** and **Car**.

---

## Example A — Tree (readable silhouette first)

### Stage 1 — Stick
- Trunk line + main gesture of the tree’s “flow”
- Major branch directions only (3–6 lines)

**Check:** Can someone tell it’s a tree from 6 feet away?

### Stage 2 — Block
- Trunk = cylinder
- Canopy = 1–3 big cloud-masses (spheres/ovals)
- Branches = tapered cylinders (only major ones)

**Check:** If you erase interior lines, does the silhouette still read as “tree”?

### Stage 3 — Rough
- Clarify trunk flare, branch junctions, canopy breakup (big → medium shapes)
- Avoid leaf-detail; keep it structural

**Check:** Do branches attach convincingly (no “sticker branches”)?

### Stage 4 — Final
- Commit best contour, emphasize overlaps
- Optional texture hints (bark) ONLY where it supports form

**Check:** Still reads without shading.

---

## Example B — Car (volume + perspective consistency)

### Stage 1 — Stick
- Ground line + direction of travel
- Wheelbase line (front axle to rear axle)
- Simple “roofline” gesture

**Check:** Reads as “car” not “box”.

### Stage 2 — Block
- Main body = box (engine block)
- Cabin = second box (offset)
- Wheels = cylinders/ellipses (2–4 depending on view)

**Check:** Wheels feel planted on the same ground plane.

### Stage 3 — Rough
- Carve big planes (hood, windshield, side plane)
- Place windows + wheel wells (still loose)

**Check:** Perspective feels consistent (no “one wheel in a different universe”).

### Stage 4 — Final
- Clean silhouette, commit overlaps
- Line weight: slightly heavier on nearer edges/overlaps

**Check:** Reads clearly without rendering.
