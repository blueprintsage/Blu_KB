# Fundamentals: Drawing (Stick → Block → Rough → Final)

**Recommended repo path:** `/skills/art/fundamentals/dp/DP-ART-FUND-001.md`  
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Prereqs:** none

## Purpose
This DP defines the **universal drawing fundamentals** that apply to *anything* you draw (trees, cars, humans, creatures, props, environments):  
**Stick → Block → Rough → Final**.

This is the “engine.” Other DPs (Figure Drawing, Creature, Props, Vehicles, Environments) are **applications** that assume this engine is already in play.

## The 4-Stage Pipeline (the engine)

### Stage 1 — Stick (Intent + Action)
**Goal:** capture pose/action/gesture + major direction lines.  
**Rules:**
- One clear **line of action** (no bent spaghetti).
- Joints are dots; head is an egg/circle; chest/hips are simple masses.
- Prioritize **readability** over accuracy.

**Pass/Fail Check:**  
Can someone name what it is doing/what it is at a glance?

### Stage 2 — Block (Volume + Depth)
**Goal:** turn lines into **forms** (cylinders, boxes, spheres).  
**Rules:**
- Use **overlap** to show depth.
- Add **wrap/contour lines** (rubber bands) to prove volume.
- Anchor big shapes first (torso/engine block/canopy/trunk) before details.

**Pass/Fail Check:**  
If you erase all interior lines, does the silhouette still read in 3D?

### Stage 3 — Rough (Structure + Planes)
**Goal:** refine proportions, planes, and major details without committing.  
**Rules:**
- Carve planes (plateaus) and curves (turns) intentionally.
- Clarify intersections (where forms connect).
- Begin feature placement (windows/branches/limbs), still loose.

**Pass/Fail Check:**  
Do the forms “sit” in the same space (no floating parts, no tangents)?

### Stage 4 — Final (Selection + Confidence)
**Goal:** commit to the best lines, remove noise, clarify depth.  
**Rules:**
- Reject weak lines. Keep only lines that **build form**.
- Use line weight sparingly: heavier toward camera / overlap edges.
- Clean silhouette first; details second.

**Pass/Fail Check:**  
Does it look intentional and readable without shading?

## Depth Rules (minimum viable 3D)
1. **Overlap beats detail** (near form overlaps far form).
2. **Scale beats anatomy** (near = bigger, far = smaller).
3. **Wrap lines prove volume** (contour = “this is a cylinder/box”).
4. **Silhouette is king** (if silhouette reads, drawing reads).
5. **One horizon mindset** (keep perspective consistent per object cluster).

## Default Drill Stack (PD references)
> These are your “daily fundamentals.” They’re short and measurable.

1. **PD-ART-FUND-001 — 10-Min Action Sticks**  
5 sticks × 1 minute (run/jump/reach/punch/fall).  
Check: action readable from across room.

2. **PD-ART-FUND-002 — 10-Min Form Blocking**  
Same 5 poses; add chest/hips ovals + limb cylinders.  
Check: overlap + wrap lines present.

3. **PD-ART-FUND-003 — Z-Axis Depth Drill (Foreshortening)**  
3-circle overlap limb, taper, silhouette, weight.  
Check: near segment clearly dominates.

4. **PD-ART-FUND-004 — Object Swap (Any Subject)**  
Pick any object (tree, car, chair): run all 4 stages.  
Check: silhouette reads at Stage 2.

## When to Escalate to an Application DP
If the fundamentals are working but you need domain specifics:
- **Figure Drawing** → anatomy + proportion + gesture nuance
- **Creature/Animal** → locomotion + anatomy variants
- **Vehicles/Props** → perspective systems + design language
- **Environments** → composition + scale systems

**Rule:** Applications never replace fundamentals; they **build on** them.
