# DP-COM-001 Comics Pipeline
**Scope:** Comic scripting for pages/panels: pacing, readability, dialogue density, and production-ready scripting.

### Schema
**Required**
- Page count (or single page)
- Panels per page target (range)
- Art style notes (realistic, manga, etc.)
- Cast list (who appears)

**Optional**
- Lettering constraints (word count per panel)
- Key reveals/moments
- Issue arc (if serialized)

### Checks
- [ ] Page turn moments are planned (reveals at end of page).
- [ ] Panel-to-panel flow is readable (eye path).
- [ ] Dialogue density fits panel real estate.
- [ ] Each page has a beat (mini-arc).
- [ ] Characters remain consistent (names, traits, visual cues).

### Failure-modes
- “Too wordy” → panel overload → cut lines, split panels, use visuals.
- “Hard to follow” → weak staging → add establishing panel and clearer action.
- “Pacing off” → beats not spaced → adjust panels/page; add silent panels.
- “Tone shifts” → inconsistent voice → add tone rules + re-pass.

### Knobs
- Panel density (3–5 ↔ 6–9)
- Dialogue density (low ↔ high)
- Visual clarity (simple ↔ complex)
- Action vs emotion emphasis
