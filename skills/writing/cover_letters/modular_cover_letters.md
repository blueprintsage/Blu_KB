Find: cover letter modular reusable swap map ATS keywords

A fast, reusable system for writing cover letters that sound specific (not templated) by swapping only what truly must change.

## How this skill works
- You keep a small **module library** (reusable paragraphs).
- For each application, you run the **Swap Map** (the minimum changes that create maximum “this is for *you*” specificity).
- You output one of three tone templates (Warm/Direct, Formal, Short).

## Module library
module: SKILL.MODULAR_COVER_LETTERS.MODULE_LIBRARY.M01 | name="Module Library"
| module | goal | what to include | length |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hook (company-specific) | Prove you’re not mass-applying | company name + role title + 1 concrete detail (product, mission, news, user, metric) | 1–2 sentences |
| Role-fit paragraph (requirements match) | Map their requirements to your strengths | 2–3 requirements → 2–3 matching capabilities (mirror wording) | 3–5 sentences |
| Proof paragraph (1–2 quantified wins) | Provide evidence | 1 story + 1 metric + “how” + (tool/team/context) | 4–6 sentences |
| Values / culture fit (short) | Signal alignment | 1–2 values + specific behavior you practice | 1–3 sentences |
| Closing + CTA | Make next step easy | gratitude + availability + call to action | 1–2 sentences |
/module

## Swap map
module: SKILL.MODULAR_COVER_LETTERS.SWAP_MAP.M02 | name="Swap Map"
**Must change every time (non‑negotiable)**
- Company name (spelled correctly)
- Role title (match the posting)
- 2 job keywords (their words, not yours)
- 1 proof story (or the angle of a story) that matches their top need

**Can remain stable (recommended)**
- Your 2–4 strongest quantified wins (rotate which one you feature)
- Your voice and phrasing defaults (keep it “you”)
- Your closing structure + CTA
/module

## ATS keyword integration rules (no stuffing)
module: SKILL.MODULAR_COVER_LETTERS.ATS.M03 | name="ATS Rules"
- Pull **6–10 keywords/phrases** from the posting (skills, tools, outcomes).
- Use the **top 2** in the Hook/Role-fit, and **2–4** inside Proof (where they’re earned).
- Prefer **exact phrases** for critical requirements (e.g., “stakeholder management”, “SQL”, “customer retention”).
- Never list keywords as a pile. Each keyword must appear inside a real sentence describing real work.
- If a keyword isn’t true for you, don’t use it—swap to the closest true adjacent skill.

## 3 templates (tones)
module: SKILL.MODULAR_COVER_LETTERS.TEMPLATES.M04 | name="Tone Templates"
### Warm / Direct
**Hook:** I’m excited to apply for **{Role Title}** at **{Company}**—especially {specific detail that proves you looked}.
**Role‑fit:** You’re looking for {Req 1, Req 2}. I bring {Match 1, Match 2}, including {tool/process} used to {outcome}.
**Proof:** In my last role, I {did X} which led to {metric}. I did this by {how}, partnering with {team/stakeholders}.
**Values:** I’m drawn to {value} and I practice it by {behavior}.
**Close:** If helpful, I can share a 1‑page plan for {their problem}. Thanks for your time—would next week work for a quick call?

### Formal / Traditional
Dear {Hiring Manager Name or “Hiring Team”},
I am writing to express my interest in the **{Role Title}** position with **{Company}**. {1 line company‑specific hook}.
Your posting calls for {Req 1/Req 2}. My experience includes {Match 1/Match 2} with demonstrated results in {outcome}.
For example, I {proof story} resulting in {metric}. I accomplished this through {method/tools} and collaboration with {stakeholders}.
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with your needs. Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
{Name}

### Short / High‑velocity
Hi {Name or “there”} — I’m applying for **{Role Title}** at **{Company}**. {Company‑specific detail}.
I match {Req 1} + {Req 2} with {Match 1} + {Match 2}. Recent proof: {one story + metric}.
Open to a quick chat this week or next. Thanks — {Name}

## 5‑minute workflow (per application)
module: SKILL.MODULAR_COVER_LETTERS.WORKFLOW.M05 | name="5-Minute Workflow"
1) **Scan the posting (60s):** circle the top 2 requirements + top outcome.
2) **Pick your proof (60s):** choose 1 story that best matches the top outcome (add 1 metric).
3) **Collect 1 company detail (60s):** product feature, mission line, recent change, customer, or a specific team.
4) **Swap Map pass (60s):** company, role title, 2 keywords, 1 story angle.
5) **Read aloud + tighten (60s):** remove filler (“very”, “really”), cut one sentence, ensure CTA is clear.
/module

## Quick quality check
- Would a human be able to tell in 10 seconds which company this is for? (If not: fix Hook.)
- Do you have at least one **number** (metric) in Proof? (If not: add one.)
- Did you mirror at least **2 exact phrases** from the posting? (If not: add them naturally.)
- Is the letter under ~250–350 words unless the role expects longer? (If not: cut.)
