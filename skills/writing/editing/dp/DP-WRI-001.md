# DP-WRI-001 Writing & Editing
**Scope:** Fiction (horror), general drafting, academic polish, revision workflows.

### Schema
**Required**
- Genre/form (story / essay / email / academic)
- Target length
- Audience + tone
- Core intent (scare / persuade / explain)
- Constraints (POV, tense, style rules)

**Optional**
- Outline/beats
- “Do not change” list (terms, claims, citations)
- Reference examples

### Checks
- [ ] Opening establishes voice + stakes by paragraph 2.
- [ ] Each paragraph has a job (scene move / reveal / argument).
- [ ] No POV/tense drift (unless intentional).
- [ ] Claims (academic) are preserved; improvements don’t introduce new facts.
- [ ] Revision pass includes: clarity, pacing, consistency, and line-level polish.

### Failure-modes
- “Reads flat” → generic verbs and nouns → add concrete sensory detail + specificity knob.
- “Pacing drags” → too much setup → compress setup; move reveal earlier.
- “Confusing argument” → weak signposting → add topic sentences + transitions.
- “Tone mismatch” → wrong register → shift diction + sentence length.
- “Accidental invention (academic)” → over-eager rewrite → lock claims; rewrite only structure/grammar.

### Knobs
- Tone (formal ↔ casual; ominous ↔ grounded)
- Pacing (slow burn ↔ brisk)
- Specificity (abstract ↔ concrete)
- Voice (plain ↔ lyrical)
- Structure (outline ↔ narrative)
- Intensity (subtle ↔ extreme)
- Editing level (light copyedit ↔ deep rewrite)

### Working Patterns
**PAT-WRI-001 Constraints → Outline → Draft → Revise**
- **Use when:** user wants reliable quality quickly.
- **Steps:** lock constraints → outline beats → draft pass → revision pass (clarity/pacing/voice).
- **Checks:** constraints respected; each beat advances; revision removes the biggest blocker first.
- **Failure-modes:** discovery writing desired → skip outline (knob).
- **Knobs:** outline depth; tone; pacing.

**PAT-WRI-002 Tighten Pass**
- **Use when:** prose is bloated.
- **Steps:** remove filler → sharpen verbs → cut repeats → vary sentence length.
- **Checks:** word count down; meaning preserved; voice intact.
- **Failure-modes:** voice loss → keep signature phrases; reduce cuts.
- **Knobs:** aggressiveness; voice preservation.

### Drills
- **DRL-WRI-001 (10 min):** Rewrite 200 words in 2 tones; keep facts unchanged.
- **DRL-WRI-002 (15 min):** Outline a scene/argument with a clear turn + 3 checks.
