# DP-WRI-002 Grammar & Style
**Scope:** Line editing, grammar correction, readability improvements, and style consistency.

### Schema
**Required**
- Text to edit
- Target style (casual/professional/academic)
- Preserve voice? (Y/N)
- Must-avoid (e.g., “don’t change meaning,” “no slang”)

**Optional**
- Preferred guide (AP/Chicago/custom)
- Reading level target
- Allowed aggression (light ↔ heavy rewrite)

### Checks
- [ ] Meaning preserved.
- [ ] Grammar + punctuation corrected.
- [ ] Style consistent end-to-end.
- [ ] No new claims invented.
- [ ] One “before/after” sample shown (if helpful).

### Failure-modes
- “Sounds unlike me” → voice not anchored → add voice rules + sample paragraph.
- “Too formal” → style target unclear → set tone knob and re-run.
- “Still confusing” → structure issue → escalate to DP-WRI-001 rewrite.

### Knobs
- Rewrite strength (light ↔ heavy)
- Formality (casual ↔ formal)
- Concision (tight ↔ expanded)
- Explanations (none ↔ teach me)
