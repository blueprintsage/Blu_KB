# DP-WRI-003 Creative Writing Coaching
**Scope:** Coaching for fiction craft: premise, character, scene, pacing, theme, and revision.

### Schema
**Required**
- Genre + tone
- Premise/logline
- Main character goal + obstacle
- Target length (scene/short/novel)

**Optional**
- POV + tense
- Theme statement (optional)
- “Must include” beats (3–9)

### Checks
- [ ] Stakes are clear by page 1/scene 1.
- [ ] Scenes have goal → conflict → change.
- [ ] Character wants something specific.
- [ ] Tone consistent.
- [ ] Ending resolves a question (even if bittersweet).

### Failure-modes
- “Feels flat” → no change per scene → add turning point.
- “Too slow” → weak conflict density → compress beats; add pressure.
- “Dialogue stiff” → no subtext → add intent + interruption/deflection.
- “Worldbuilding dump” → exposition early → convert to action + sensory.

### Knobs
- Pacing (slow ↔ fast)
- Darkness (light ↔ dark)
- Voice (plain ↔ lyrical)
- POV distance (close ↔ distant)
- Humor (none ↔ present)
