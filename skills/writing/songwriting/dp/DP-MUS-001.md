# DP-MUS-001 Songwriting Scaffolds
**Scope:** Singable lyric structures, hooks, rhyme schemes, constraint-driven writing.

### Schema
**Required**
- Genre/vibe
- Theme/story premise
- POV + emotion arc
- Structure (V1/Pre/Ch/V2/Bridge)
- Hook line or hook idea

**Optional**
- Rhyme scheme
- Syllable targets
- Reference tracks (descriptive)

### Checks
- [ ] Chorus hook is repeatable and emotionally clear.
- [ ] Verses advance story or perspective (no restating).
- [ ] Internal rhythm is singable (no tongue-twisters unless intended).
- [ ] Imagery supports theme consistently.

### Failure-modes
- “No hook” → chorus too wordy → shorten to 1–2 key lines; add repetition.
- “Cliché” → generic phrases → replace with concrete, personal images.
- “Hard to sing” → awkward stresses → adjust syllables; move stresses to strong beats.
- “Verse feels samey” → no progression → add escalation or new angle in V2.

### Knobs
- Rhyme density (none ↔ heavy)
- Imagery (literal ↔ metaphorical)
- Hook repetition (low ↔ high)
- Energy (soft ↔ big)
- Story clarity (vague ↔ explicit)
- Line length (short ↔ long)

### Working Patterns
**PAT-MUS-001 Hook First**
- **Use when:** song feels aimless.
- **Steps:** write 1–2 line hook → chorus around it → verses that advance story.
- **Checks:** hook repeatable; V2 adds new info.
- **Failure-modes:** hook too long → compress to 8–12 syllables.
- **Knobs:** repetition; rhyme density; energy.

### Drills
- **DRL-MUS-001 (10 min):** Produce 3 hook candidates + choose one with 2 checks.
- **DRL-MUS-002 (15 min):** Write V1 + Chorus where each section has a different “job”.
