# DP-SCR-001 Screenwriting
**Scope:** Film/TV/web scripts: beat sheets, outlines, scene lists, draft pages, and rewrite passes.

### Schema
**Required**
- Logline
- Format target (short/feature/episode)
- Genre + tone
- Key beats (or “generate beats”)

**Optional**
- Act structure preference (3-act, etc.)
- Character list + arcs
- “Must-have” scenes/lines

### Checks
- [ ] Each act turns (inciting incident, midpoint, low point, climax).
- [ ] Every scene has a purpose (reveal, reversal, decision).
- [ ] Dialogue has conflict or subtext (not info dumps).
- [ ] Revisions are pass-based (structure → scenes → dialogue).

### Failure-modes
- “Act 2 sags” → no escalation → add complications + ticking clock.
- “Too many characters” → dilution → merge roles; cut subplots.
- “On-the-nose dialogue” → no subtext → rewrite with intent + obstacle.
- “Confusing geography” → missing scene anchors → add establishing beats.

### Knobs
- Structure strictness (loose ↔ strict)
- Scene density (sparse ↔ dense)
- Dialogue style (minimal ↔ talky)
- Stakes (low ↔ high)
