# Homeschool Index

### Credit / Source
This homeschool map is derived from publicly available course pages and directories on **All-in-One Homeschool** (Easy Peasy All-in-One Homeschool) and **All-in-One High School**. All course content, lesson structure, and original materials remain the property of their respective owners. This repo provides **links and organizational indexing only** for navigation and planning.

### Homeschool legal note
Homeschooling requirements vary by jurisdiction. **Each U.S. state (and each country/region) has its own homeschooling laws and reporting requirements.** Before relying on these teaching workflows for compliance, **check your local/state regulations** (attendance tracking, portfolios, testing, notices of intent, and required subjects).
