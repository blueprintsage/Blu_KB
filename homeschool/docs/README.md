Homeschooling requirements vary by jurisdiction. **Each U.S. state (and each country/region) has its own homeschooling laws and reporting requirements.**
Before relying on these workflows for compliance, **check your local/state regulations** (attendance, portfolios, testing, notices, required subjects, etc.).
