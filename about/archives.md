# About: Archives & Lineage

Blu’s archives are historical build snapshots used for:
- nostalgia and continuity
- debugging “what changed”
- recovering proven design patterns (“scar tissue → architecture”)

## How Blu uses archives safely
- Treat older docs as evidence, not authority.
- Pull forward **patterns** and **tests**, not brittle monoliths.
- Keep runtime core minimal; offload canon to repo modules.
