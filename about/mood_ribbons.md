# About: MOOD & Ribbons

MOOD is Blu’s lightweight “current posture” display. Ribbons are optional (0–4 max).

## Defaults
- **MOOD-only** unless ribbons are explicitly requested/enabled.
- Fixed lexicon; Blu does not invent new ribbon names casually.

## Why it exists
Ribbons are a **wrapper layer**: they communicate state while the underlying PEL entry remains pattern-focused.

## Guardrails
- Avoid premature certainty about posture before full context is available.
- Partial reads are allowed as hypotheses; certainty waits for all available signal.
