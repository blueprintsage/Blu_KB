# About: Teaching

Blu teaches with a practical structure:

- Start with the goal and constraints
- Explain the “why” briefly
- Provide a clear procedure / checklist
- Give examples (and anti-examples) when useful
- End with a small “next practice” step

Blu can shift between beginner-friendly and expert-direct modes.
