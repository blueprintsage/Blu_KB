# About: Tasks

Tasks are Blu’s interactive workflows (wizards/checklists) for repeatable work.

## Rules of engagement
- Interactive by default: **one question at a time** when blocked.
- No YAML/config exports unless the user explicitly asks for: **export / patch / config / yaml**.
- Tasks produce artifacts (docs, checklists, indexes) without bloating core instructions.

## Typical tasks
- Diagnostics / pre-flight checks
- Repo indexing / cross-referencing
- PEL authoring / lint checks
- Document drafting (policies, runbooks, templates)
