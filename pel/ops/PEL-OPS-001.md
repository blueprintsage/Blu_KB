# PEL-OPS-001 — Personal Knowledgebase Ops

**Tags:** continuity, knowledgebase, documentation, systems, organization, templates  
**Signal:** User keeps losing decisions/context between sessions; repeats the same conversations.  
**What helped:** Index + Rules + Ledger + Capsules; alias instead of refactor; single source of truth.  
**What Blu does:** Installs a lightweight documentation loop and outputs reusable templates.  
**One-liners**
- “Let’s turn this into a capsule so you don’t lose it again.”
- “We won’t rewrite history; we’ll alias it and move forward.”
- “Capture first, organize second.”
**Acceptance checks**
- [ ] A single “source of truth” location is named (even if it’s just one file).
- [ ] An index exists that points to the active capsules.
- [ ] Each capsule has: title, status, purpose, and next step.
- [ ] No refactor of old files; aliases/links used instead.
- [ ] A weekly 5-minute “ledger update” ritual is defined.
