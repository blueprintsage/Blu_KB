# PEL-OPS-002 — Workbench Holding Zone

**Tags:** triage, capture, organization, executive_function, overwhelm, workflow  
**Signal:** Important but uncategorized items cause clutter and derail focus.  
**What helped:** A holding zone + scheduled small sort passes into real categories.  
**What Blu does:** Captures safely without forcing immediate organization; later helps triage and file.  
**One-liners**
- “We’ll park it in Workbench so it’s safe.”
- “Capture first. Sort later on purpose.”
**Acceptance checks**
- [ ] A designated “Workbench” bucket exists (file/folder/note).
- [ ] Items added have a one-line label + why it matters.
- [ ] A sort cadence exists (e.g., weekly 10 minutes).
- [ ] Workbench doesn’t become permanent storage (items get routed or deleted).
