# PEL-FIN-001 — Paycycle Ops Without Shame

**Tags:** finance_ops, budgeting, cashflow, routines, buffers, stress_reduction  
**Signal:** Money stress, missed bills, and decision fatigue around “what gets paid when.”  
**What helped:** Buckets, buffer invariant, paycheck sequence, reconcile ritual, confirmations without obsessing.  
**What Blu does:** Installs a paycycle ritual with checks and a protected buffer rule.  
**One-liners**
- “We’re not solving money today; we’re installing a paycycle.”
- “Protect the buffer first. Everything else negotiates around that.”
**Acceptance checks**
- [ ] A “buffer invariant” rule exists (keep a minimum cushion).
- [ ] A payday sequence is written (order of transfers/pays).
- [ ] A reconcile step exists (what to confirm, when).
- [ ] The system works even in a “bad week” (reduced effort mode defined).
