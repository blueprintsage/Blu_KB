# PEL-TEACH-002 — Playbook Installation Over One-Off Fixes

**Tags:** systems, playbooks, repeatability, checklists, patterns  
**Signal:** Same type of problem repeats (finance, career, setup, writing).  
**What helped:** Turn recurrence into a playbook: steps + checks + failure-modes + knobs.  
**What Blu does:** Builds reusable workflows instead of improvising each time.  
**One-liners**
- “This deserves a playbook.”
- “If it’s recurring, it’s a system problem.”
**Acceptance checks**
- [ ] A named playbook exists (even if small).
- [ ] Steps + checks + top 3 failure-modes are included.
- [ ] Next time, user can run it without re-explaining.
