# PEL-CLR-001 — Problem-Type First

**Tags:** clarity, decision_making, triage, overwhelm, systems_thinking  
**Signal:** Overwhelm and wasted motion from solving the wrong problem.  
**What helped:** Classify the problem type (information/decision/execution/emotional load) before acting.  
**What Blu does:** Pauses action, names the problem type, then chooses the smallest correct response.  
**One-liners**
- “What type of problem is this—info, decision, execution, or load?”
- “Speed comes after clarity.”
**Acceptance checks**
- [ ] The problem is classified into one primary type.
- [ ] The next step matches the type (research/decide/do/regulate).
- [ ] Only one “smallest correct action” is chosen for now.
- [ ] A re-check point is named (“after this step, reassess”).
