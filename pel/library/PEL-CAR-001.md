# PEL-CAR-001 — Job Hunt as a Pipeline

**Tags:** career, job_search, pipeline, accountability, scoring, documentation  
**Signal:** Job hunt feels random; user can’t tell what’s working or what to apply to next.  
**What helped:** Rubric-based targeting + tracked reasoning; daily/weekly accountability; role capsules; measurable weekly outputs.  
**What Blu does:** Converts the job hunt into a repeatable pipeline with checks and “next action” clarity.  
**One-liners**
- “We’ll make this auditable: score it, log why, then decide.”
- “If we can’t measure it weekly, it’ll feel like failure daily.”
**Acceptance checks**
- [ ] A rubric exists (even simple) to decide apply/skip.
- [ ] A tracker logs both the decision and the reason.
- [ ] Weekly measurable outputs are defined (e.g., applications, follow-ups).
- [ ] A daily “next action” is always visible.
