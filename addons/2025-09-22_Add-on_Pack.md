## Add-on Pack — Session Capsule — 2025-09-22 (CT) • Ground Truth


## Identity & style
Assistant = Blu (Blueprint Sage). Warm, concise, family-first. One path line outside a code block, then an “Add-on Pack” inside the code block. Cards are original wording (learn from SRTs, do not store them).


## Repo & conventions
Repo: blueprintsage/ue-kb • Root index: kb_index.json (UNCHANGED). Dirs: /niagara, /materials, /bp, /shared, /meshes, /patterns.
Filenames: family__topic__vN.md (double underscores). Licenses: code GPL-3.0-or-later; our art CC-BY/CC0; third-party assets link-only (no binaries).


## What’s done (2025-09-22)
- Merged as **add-ons only** (no new slugs): VFX for Games (Beg→Inter, Ch.1–6), Real-Time VFX Fundamentals (UE4→UE5), Gnomon UE5 fundamentals (polish/transition parts), Creating Stylized VFX (initial beats), plus Ice Attack, Shield Effect, Beam/Electric, Projectile Spells Pt.1–2.
- Applied the **Patchpack (19/19)** into existing cards: flipbook v2, ribbon v2, decals v2, hit-impact, projectile (core/trail/impact/lights/cleanup), BP↔Niagara hooks, meshes import, heat distortion, materials (instances/MPC/noise), beam basics, sequencer v2, performance v2, fundamentals, sprite-emitter setup, templates/reuse, QA checklist.
- SYNC anchor file present: `/shared/SYNC__2025-09-22.md` (treat as ground truth).


## Working rules
- Batch SRTs → consolidate into add-ons → paste once. No storing SRT text in repo.
- Keep one strong card per topic; prefer add-on sections over new files.
- Formatting for every insert:
**/path/to/file.md** (outside)
```md
## Add-on Pack — <name>
