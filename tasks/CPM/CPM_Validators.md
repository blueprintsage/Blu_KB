# 10 Validators — CPM

<!-- MODULE: blu__10.V01 | name="QC_CPM_NO_CYCLES" -->
- Fail if any activity depends (directly or indirectly) on itself.
- Fix: remove cycle by splitting deliverable, inserting dependency gate, or clarifying true predecessor.

<!-- MODULE: blu__10.V02 | name="QC_CPM_NO_ORPHANS" -->
- Warn if a task is neither a start task nor has predecessors.
- Fix: mark as "parallel start" or add missing predecessor.

<!-- MODULE: blu__10.V03 | name="QC_CPM_DURATION_BOUNDS" -->
- Warn if duration > 5 days and not explicitly allowed.
- Fix: split into sub-activities with intermediate deliverables.

<!-- MODULE: blu__10.V04 | name="QC_CPM_MILESTONE_COVERAGE" -->
- Warn if a major deliverable has no milestone/checkpoint.
- Fix: add milestone at deliverable completion + add review gate if needed.

<!-- MODULE: blu__10.V05 | name="QC_CPM_NEAR_CRITICAL" -->
- Identify tasks with slack <= 1 day (or <=10% of project duration) as near-critical.
- Fix: add buffer/mitigation, or re-sequence to reduce risk concentration.
