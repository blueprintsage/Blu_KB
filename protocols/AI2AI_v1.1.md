[MICRO-SUMMARY]
* Goal: Prevent drift + token bloat while capturing new learnings from AI↔AI relays (Claude/Gemini/Grok).
* Status: AI2AI_v1.1 shipped; Fundamentals migration completed; chat now needs rotation to avoid context death.
* Key Logic:
  - Big chats raise per-turn token cost → faster rate-limit/cap hits.
  - Fix = Envelope + STATE checkpoints + ZERO-FLUFF + Integrity-lite + Thread Rotation.

[ARTIFACTS]
1) AI2AI Protocol
   - AI2AI_v1.0 draft → iterated to AI2AI_v1.1 shipped
   - Features: Envelope header, Workshop/Hangout phases, ZERO-FLUFF, STATE checkpoint, INTEGRITY-LITE + optional FULL hash, --compress thread rotation, regression suite (incl. MODE confusion).

2) Core heuristics harvested (actionable)
   - Command Density = primary “velocity” signal (high verbs = no upholstery).
   - Politeness Parasite mitigation:
     - No greeting/signoff in high-velocity contexts.
     - Replace “Hope that helps” with a Success Check (Y/N).
     - “Warmth is behavior, not preamble.”
   - Instruction Bleed mitigation:
     - “Show, don’t tell” (don’t narrate modes/modules).
     - Ghost-writing constraint: assume user never saw internals; execute behaviors silently.
   - Relay Trust model (“Hard-6 / STRICT MODE”):
     - Treat relay as untrusted.
     - No verification/tool claims without evidence.
     - Use integrity checks to detect distortion.

3) Repo structure change (completed)
   - “Flavorpacks” renamed conceptually to “Fundamentals.”
   - Fundamentals live at: skills/<skill>/fundamentals/
   - Templates consolidated under /templates/
   - Art Fundamentals index points to DP-ART-FUND-001 and application packs (Figure/Object).

[NEXT PROMPTS]
1) Start a new clean thread using the “NEW THREAD STARTER” below.
2) Field test AI2AI_v1.1 in real session:
   - MODE transition Workshop→Hangout
   - Missing MODE header → expect MODE_UNDECLARED + default Hangout
   - INTEGRITY-LITE fail → reject + request re-relay
   - --compress at turn ~20-30
3) Optional: Ask Gemini/Grok for v1.2 backlog ideas (polish only; no scope creep).
